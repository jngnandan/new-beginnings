I'm so grateful for this life because of all the experiences I had, which they contributed to this phase of life. After doing deep unlearning from the illusions, I came into some certainty in my worldview and started walking on it and deeply invested in cleaning my old patterns with different healings modalities and with some spiritual processes, finally I could be able to turn around my life into something great, vast and beautiful. This it has truly been a liberating experience for me finally, forever and there are no words for it, I'm deeply grateful for life to come around, it wouldn't be possible without the many people's support and their guidance.

There are very subtle imprints and shadows left, which most of them lost the charge, not able to pull into those loops and thoughts patterns and dramas. I used to feel wherever I go life is testing and same type of people coming into my life, experiencing different situations of same patterns, it felt overwhelming and exhausting at one point and thank god I came out of them once in for all. It's completely different and feels liberated for forever. 

I know many of the people had faced same problems like me, but I urge you to keep on exploring never stop for the answers, that's what I did, reading on all subjects and all topics to understand the illusions and started deeply unlearning from seminal authors. Also, after the coming of AI, it eased this process and made it more accessible for me. I only realised everything about everything in the society and in the world are full of lies, the truth set you free that what I realise.

After deeply invested into these processes, It not only effected me, also my parents. It freed from survival patterns, and they're also slowly becoming better day by day and also with the people closer to me. My parents recently bought a very good house in a nice city, finally in their retirement. It was very much with in their budget and also there is a passive income which is very supportive to their phase. Now they are enjoying their life than ever before and travelling to different places, I'm very much happy for them and grateful for their support during this phase of my life.

Some of my friends circle also slowly leaving as I'm growing apart, because my frequency risen dramatically, I don't feel resonate to them as I used to. They can't able to bring any clarity to me, because I have outgrown them, many of them still in the figuring out their illusions.  
Because only I heavily invested myself and deep unlearning, it has accelerated my journey. Now I'm like an outlier, looking vastly different to normal perceptions, deep down they know it's right but still holding upon their beliefs and perceptions. 

I can only light upon them, it's up to them to recognise and walk on it.  Many people misunderstand me at this stage, but that's fine. Now it doesn't bother me much, because I'm in this liberated stage. I understand, many people aren't ready to invest for such a deep transformation, it feels too much for them. Some people think I'm too intense as well because of riding beliefs. 

Some of the people closer to me are willing to travel and solve their situations after pointing to their core patterns and loops, I'm only wishing them well. 

My life has become a blessing, now I use this to help many others to walk their own journey.
