I love reading, it’s my best hobby and I can’t imagine myself without reading and it helped a lot to expand my awareness.

I have horizontally explored many areas based on my interests. The recent books which worked out for me and some of the seminal books created a great impact on me and my worldview. I would like to note down some of the things I learned and which might help you also.

## Make Time: How to focus on what matters every day  
by Jake Knapp & John Zeratsky

This book helped me to how to plan time and align to the things that matters most instead of performance for sake. It came from Product designers from Google, they earlier something called sprint framework before.

Digital products are intentionally designed to create distractions, this book talks about how to preserve time and only focus on few things that matter and laser focus on during the day by allocating time and reflect on it end of the day how it went.

## Counterrevolution and Revolt by Herbert Marcuse

This book talks about how advanced industrial capitalism absorbed or repressed revolutionary energy. It talks about how consumerism, mass media, technocratic systems control population and destroy revolutionary consciousness.

Failure of new left and technocratic domination with promise of false needs, which is shaped by efficiency, productivity, surveillance. What is the solution, Marcuse call for new sensibility of Aesthetic and ecological dimension of revolt, which includes deep transformation of perception, values and needs.

## Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul

Seth Speaks is a groundbreaking metaphysical text that explores the true nature of reality, the soul, and human existence from the perspective of a non-physical consciousness named Seth, channelled by Jane Roberts.

The book reveals that we are eternal, multidimensional beings living simultaneous lives across time and space. It challenges linear concepts of time, death, and identity, offering a cosmic framework in which thoughts, beliefs, and emotions shape our physical reality. Seth invites readers to awaken to their creative power, explore their deeper spiritual self, and understand that consciousness is the source of all that is.

# Social Justice Fallacies by Thomas Sowell

Thomas Sowell is my favourite intellectual, he exposes many fallacies in the society, this book is like summary of many of his earlier works. It critiques the assumptions behind modern social justice movements. Drawing from decades of economic research and historical analysis, Sowell challenges widely held beliefs about inequality, systemic oppression, and group outcomes. He argues that many social justice claims ignore basic economic principles, historical complexity, and human behavioural realities.

The book dismantles ideas like equal outcomes as a measure of fairness, the belief that disparities always indicate injustice, and the notion that government intervention can easily engineer equity. With clear logic and real-world examples, Sowell invites readers to rethink popular narratives and examine how good intentions can lead to harmful results when divorced from facts.
