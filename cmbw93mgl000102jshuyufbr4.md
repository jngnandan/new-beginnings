I came from a middle class family, Hindu family background, but I’ve always had a sense of scepticism towards religious practices and social norms. I’m not a religious person. I’ve always been a truth seeker—questioning things and not simply accepting the immediate norms presented by society. Not in an explicit, confrontational way, but I’ve always known these norms are not the ultimate truth.

After my Diploma in tool and die making, at the end of my one-year internship at Tata Motors, I had a strong desire to go to Germany for higher studies. It felt like the right place for my engineering background. But I couldn’t go—my father wasn’t very supportive in that direction. So, I ended up joining a college near my parents’ place.

### **Existential Crisis:**

It was a completely different environment from what I wanted. The people around me, and their overall approach to education, were hard to adjust to. I had a little more exposure and awareness than what that place offered. Their approach was very controlling and disciplined—almost like military-style education. I also noticed that people behaved in the opposite way to the rules, probably out of repression.

I’ve always been very much against authoritarian ways of operating. I value awareness and dignity. I felt really bad for people—how the management treated students without dignity through rigid rules. I knew it wasn’t my place. I felt totally out of alignment with that environment.

During that time, I started reading non-fiction using my Kindle in classrooms, instead of listening to lectures. I gained so much more knowledge from those books than from the textbooks. That’s how I felt.

After I graduated, I immediately joined a 10-day Vipassana meditation camp. It was really intensive. There, I met someone who worked in the film industry. He gave me some insight into what’s happening in the world and introduced me to Noam Chomsky’s work. After Vipassana, life felt easy like for 15 days I would say, and I got interested to do more as well.

I started reading what he suggested, and I also shared things I found along the way. That exchange really expanded my understanding.

### **Seeking for Inclusivity:**

Later, I began working as a UI/UX Designer after gaining skills post-graduation. It was at a mid-size company, filled with employees from top schools. It was exciting in the beginning. But again, I didn’t like the long hours. Mostly, it was the lack of freedom—I felt like they were spying on us. The founder would take team lectures, pointing out who did what without mentioning names. I felt my personal space and privacy were being intruded upon. I couldn’t even speak openly with friends and family about the job or the company environment, then I resigned for higher studies. I also felt to comply with high ambitious people and inferiority complex, how much ever I try, it was not very inclusive. Likewise, I thought living abroad would give me a chance of equal opportunities and might be more inclusive.

### **Foreign Experience:**

Then, I moved to the UK for higher studies. That experience was wild, I felt good with first impressions. I found it a bit difficult to adjust, especially in the first year. It was also during the Covid period. I had more free time during my studies, which I used to read more and more about everything. Didn’t have part-time jobs for 6 months, but experiencing my abroad life overall. I also didn’t like roommates, I really need to find like-minded people. I was doing meditations more consistently daily

The second half of the semester, I moved to London and began experimenting with different jobs—looking for something that aligned with my passion. I fell in love with London was more diversity and richness etc, at the same time It was more expensive than outside London; it felt like constant pressure every month.

It gave more opportunity to try different things, work in many different places as well.

After many circles of monthly bill payments, I got to deal with the cash flow, something I wasn’t used to before. I have a hope that I could settle and my parents and relatives are little proud of me etc.

After trying many different jobs, I realized I can reduce my work so much, but yet still I don’t feel satisfied.

### **Different Job Experiences:**

For part-time jobs, most were filled with subcontractors. The pay was just not enough to save, After having more connections It led me to some comfortable work. But for many it requires a lot of physical work in the name of standards. Many of them somehow accepted it because of the dignity or status, I can see all of them. I see many people are getting physically exhausted for chasing more money and to save, I can understand their situation at the same time, their body is not relaxed to work on something they love.

In professional jobs, I noticed that the stress just shifts from physical to mental. That’s the only difference I saw. I came across because for reviews, we need to act and, being forced to comply with company rules, and so on. But I found no authenticity overall, and there were also no boundaries. You have to completely submit to the authorities, regardless of how you felt. In return, you’d get decent pay and societal recognition.

I even tried launching my own startup after developing strong skills in software development and design. But I observed that these high-demand skills were becoming outdated every year. It was hard to keep up. Eventually, I realized you can’t do everything yourself. You’d need investments, hire others, and go through different growth stages. It requires a lot of intensive work, if you don’t like it won’t work eventually as well is what I felt.

At the same time, I was reading and researching a lot—trying to understand the Western systems and why things are the way they are.

### **Systemic Realisation:**

After reading over 1000 books, living in 20 different houses, doing many jobs in many different places, and working with many nationalities— I came to see that many people are caught in the same system in the name of standards. Some don’t know how to describe these experiences, deep down they know it’s not right but still for the sake of recognition and material comfort, they accepted the rules given by the system.

Overall, I saw that everything is rigged. I had enough. I took more time to introspection, reading, and day to day basis reflections, I realized fulfilment is what matters eventually, this what I was telling to my peers as well. I was just flowing with the system after understanding it all. Furthermore, I also spent a good amount of time with a psychologist—around 6 months, doing many recreational activities travelling, swimming etc. Last 6 months I really enjoyed my life, people around me also little jealous of me because how happy I’m without getting caught up in worldly responsibilities etc. They see that I’m glowing and revitalised, from dullness.

I also felt psychology not the ultimate solution, it’s only temporary because they are seeing through frameworks. They couldn’t completely solve or heal the patterns I was dealing with. There was a sense of judgment and a subtle “less-than them” approach, they are not truly caring unless we pay is little off to me as well.

Eventually, I came back to India after my visa expired. I felt I needed some support—that’s what I thought. But It was really great experience is what I feel, I came with happy experiences unlike some of my friends with a lot of exposure and knowledge on systems.

### **Spiritual Realisation:**

At some point after knowing about materialistic systems, I went to metaphysical and there I got to know there are more civilizations in the universe beyond Earth. They offered better perspectives on what’s truly going on here, and they gave some solutions and which I compared with many seminal works I read, it makes more sense.

I came across various military whistleblowers who shared insights into the same things as well. Also, with many channellers and psychics. I gave a shot on what they suggested

My spiritual process is accelerated and I found my purpose. I did a lot of shadow work. It finally worked out.

It was really life changing. I was able to heal all the patterns. Life became easier, liberated with ease. But still, outsiders seemed to think I wasn’t enough, or judged me externally. Internally I feel more fulfilled and joyful irrespectively.

I’ll share more about what I did in terms of processes soon, and subscribe for more of my authentic posts!
