I have been figuring out life, I did so many jobs from professionally and part-time to figure out which works for me. After doing all the jobs, I only realised I don’t fit in this system entirely.

I experimented with some works and jobs, working in my home country India and abroad. It was a great learning experience for my life. I was in London in other parts of UK from last 5 yrs. It was great, I’m really grateful for those experiences.

I started after my graduation

I attempted for GATE exam which is very difficult to crack, it’s mainly to get into M. Tech in premium institutions also very good for building engineering foundations. I really don’t like it because it was too much maths and the competition with many people. I attempted, but it didn’t work.

I joined in as a UI/UX Designer. It was good experience with people from top universities where I wanted to go before. It was long hours, like 12 hours a day, living with my colleagues in the same company they gave accommodation.  
The CEO was taking long sessions and blaming people indirectly, he was expert in thought patterns. It was like continuously I feel monitored and difficult to express my opinions. Then I left for freedom and that time I travelled a lot in weekends, enjoyed my days. They liked me there in the company as well.

There I realised, I’m good at this Design which is easy for me, but I feel like doing it - I’m mostly doing mockups for different startups etc. It was not for me because CEO is too much controlling in thoughts level, even though they are doing inspirational things.

I went to UK and later London. There I have done so many wide ranges of jobs.

Like this, then I went on doing small part-time jobs to working for small offices and companies. Including Marketing, Sales, HR, admin, software development, Testing, Consultant jobs etc.  
I somehow liked software development even though it’s difficult, but I like the feeling of building something which is tangible and useful tools for people.

I somehow couldn’t progress in any one path unusually even though I could develop many skill sets in some areas, I became good at it also. Some problems came externally or internally, and then I couldn’t move forward.

I also read a lot of books in the meantime, mostly nonfiction, that’s my favourite hobby and I enjoy sharing the knowledge to my peer group. I was with so many people and households, it gave me a rich experience overall.

Furthermore, I read a lot about systems and western systems. Overall, I developed independent thinking and overall general world view of my own.

People see like you need to have linear path and stable career in good. But I see value in diverse experiences, and learning lessons from them is more important.

Then I came back to India after my visa expired,

I realised support is also important for this phase, where people also see me, and then they can recognise and help me to grow, especially my parents.

After reading many books, I got expanded also into from worldly affairs to cosmological truths etc.

I have taken some psychic readings, then I got some insights that make sense.

I did deep healing work on past life karmas. After many psychic readings, realised I was carrying so much karmic weigh from other paternally and maternally as a stewardship. I did a lot of work on this continuously on these from last couple of months, the reward is slow and steady, and I’m really satisfied.

Finally, my father is retiring, we got a new house in good city. Before that, I stumbled across different areas where to take from my worldview. I realised outside the city would be good at least to meet people like me. We got it somehow and the house was very good for the price.

During this phase, I got much deep into spiritual practices, the healing and karmic healing was really intense last couple of months. My parents were really supportive to me, I’m so much grateful to them.

Now I’m in a phase where I feel fulfilled and a little more joyful inside. Still, I am doing some karmic healings left to do. But now outside situations are not creating problems, they are arranging somehow to lead this purposeful life.

It’s still unfolding, even though I have some overall clarity on it. But the steps and process I’m in really fulfilling, I’m grateful for my experiences.
