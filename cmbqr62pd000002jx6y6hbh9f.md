Throughout history, many systems have evolved and shaped the world we know today, yet core issues persist despite some advancements. We still have significant progress to make. Here are some key observations to consider:

### Principles of Democracy:

1. **Power Belongs to the People**
    
    * The government derives its power from the consent of the people.
        
    * Often, people feel powerless, which is why military and police forces are used to maintain control under the guise of law and order.
        
2. **Everyone is Equal**
    
    * Every person has equal political rights; no one is more important in a democracy.
        
    * In reality, people do not have equal rights. When issues affect ordinary citizens, especially marginalized communities, their voices often go unheard.
        
3. **Rule of Law**
    
    * No one is above the law, not even leaders.
        
    * However, the wealthy and powerful often bypass laws to their advantage.
        
4. **Freedom and Rights**
    
    * People have freedom of speech, religion, and thought, allowing them to speak against the government.
        
    * In many parts of the world, there is no freedom of speech. Media is centralized and owned by the wealthy, often biased towards leaders and business tycoons. Authorities frequently suppress cultural, religious, and intellectual expressions against them.
        
5. **Majority Rules, but Minorities are Protected**
    
    * Decisions are made by majority vote, but minority rights must be protected.
        
    * In practice, decisions are often made through internal voting by leaders, not by majority vote. Minorities frequently lack rights and face economic suppression.
        
6. **Free and Fair Elections**
    
    * Elections should be regular, open to all adults, and honest.
        
    * Often, elections appear fair but are not. Both parties are well-known, and people are sometimes paid for their votes, leading to a lack of accountability.
        

When systems operate contrary to these principles, people become brainwashed, and education is diluted. Without quality education and literacy, there is no feedback loop for self-correction, making manipulation easy.

### Three Main Branches of Power:

These branches prevent misuse of power, create checks and balances, and protect democracy and individual rights.

1. **Legislative** – Makes the laws (Parliament or Congress)
    
    * Business groups often lobby politicians with donations, data, or advice to influence policies. Majority governments often dominate, leaving little room for opposition. The public is often swayed by media. So there are no checks and balances.
        
2. **Executive** – Implements and enforces the laws & regulations (President, Prime Minister, and Ministers)
    
    * Success is often measured by fundraising, popularity and influence, not public service. Executive branch expands its power beyond constitutional limits instead of just executing laws, it ends up interpreting, enforcing laws, often bypassing executive orders. Executive behave like monarchs or emperors. Leadership is judged on **style, charisma, and image**, not substance or moral responsibility, becoming more of performers than administrators.  
          
        In cases of civil unrest, leaders may enforce laws and use military force to suppress dissent, which contradicts democratic principles. So it’s all misuse of power.
        
3. **Judiciary** – Interprets the laws and ensures justice (Courts and Judges)
    
    * Judicial processes are often complex and lengthy, delaying justice. Legal fees are unaffordable for many, favouring the rich and powerful. So there is no protection to individual rights in actuality and hence no democracy
        

**Transparency in Democracy:** Ideally, transparency should exist, but in reality, media bias and centralization often undermine it.

**Accountability:** The media often spreads false stories to distract the public, leading to a lack of true accountability. The system seems rigged, and change is hard unless people come together to recognize and tackle these problems.

They present it as a democracy to the world, but in reality, it is not. True power lies in participating in democracy. If we wait for a saviour to fix things for us, as portrayed by media and movies, it ends up repeating the same flawed system.
